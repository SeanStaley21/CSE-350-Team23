slide 8

website form submission
- need to be able to submit something first is a crucial operation
- adjusting the menu options so that they are all customizable

submission handling in backend
- the program needs to be able to take the data submitted and turn it into a ticket.
- the ticket needs to be sent to the food truck side and a receipt is sent back to customer

Live Order Queue\
- this will be either webapp or program needs to be able to receive the ticket from the backend or wherever
- display the ticket in an orderly fashion by time, so that the first/oldest ticket is at the front of the queue.
- it should be able to allow the worker to mark ticket as complete, or delete orders

Cart list
- at the end of the web submission you should be able to view the cart and see all that is there before you place the order.
- you should be able to remove items from the cart
- there should be a revamp of the order submission where you add to kart rather than just one order at a time

Order Confirmation
- the receipt from the submission handling in backend part should be received and displayed on user submission
- there should be a nice format for the receipt differently than the food trucks side of the receipt

Slide 9

- dev plan is agile/iterative
- this is because different people will be working on different parts at one time
- then we all put everything together after we finish our short stint of work to test and refine
- then we will rinse and repeat through those steps.

Slide 10
- in our first sprint we will have a webapp ui created
- the website will be able to submit the form
- the backend should be able to receive the submission.
- food truck ui will be created roughly

- in sprint 2 which will be shorter.
- we will have a live order queue made in the backend
- food truck order queue ui will be update to receive and display the live orders
- showing the  cart on the customer side should be put in as well as order/receipt confirmation

- final sprint 3
- we should be testing our features and debugging the issues
- these will be more or less worked on simultaneous to the new features being added
- after that we will be finished with the project

Slide 11
- Sean will be the project manager and frontend engineer
- Jaden will be our backend and product engineer
- Robert will be our full stack dev working with both sides
- Connor has no role due to no participation
